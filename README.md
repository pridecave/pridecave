  History and Background</div>
<ol class="about-list">
 	<li>An American transgender woman who is a part of the Scrawling Family told us what she had gone through due to transphobia. Even the authorities had refused to help her a number of times. Her story was very sad and disturbing for all of us.</li>
 	<li>That&#8217;s when we decided that we must do something about this. We discussed this issue on our Telegram group and finally, we decided to start a social media campaign to strive for the rights of the LGBTQIAPD+ community.</li>
 	<li>Our initiative &#8216;Pride Cave&#8217; was born on July 18, 2020 in the form of a Quora blog. Coincidentally, our Foundation Day (July 18) is Mandela Day!</li>
 	<li>Our campaign grew and soon, several people contacted us and expressed their sincere desire to contribute. We got many new volunteers and supporters, including a number of singers, artists, editors and members of the LGBTQIAPD+ community.</li>
